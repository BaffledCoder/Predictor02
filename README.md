# Flight Price Predictor

### I have built a simple web app model which predicts the price of flight given the departure time , arrival time , date of journey , airline etc !
### The accuracy on test data is 80 % and for the train data it goes to 95 %
### I have also included the dataset (air_train.xlsx and air_test.xlsx) , the jupyter notebook(main code) file and the pickle file !

### 2.Run the ipynb file
### 3. Use streamlit and heroku for the deployment
